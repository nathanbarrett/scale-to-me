      So just how big is the Milky Way then?

    <p class="milky-way-explain">
      In order to get a better understanding of the vastness of the Milky Way we must first
      shrink down our Solar System even more. This time we will shrink it down to the size 
      of a US Quarter.

      At this scale it takes light 4 hours and 12 minutes to get from the center of the quarter to the
      outside of the quarter. The fastest man made object in space ( 14 km / second ) would take
      10.18 years to get from the center of the quarter to the outside of the quarter. Refer
      back to this after you see the Milky Way.

      Now we need to put our new US quarter sized Solar System on the ground. Click on the GPS
      target icon to place it at your location, put in an address, or simply just click on the map to place it.
